## ðŸ’¿ Dependencies

### OS

We recommend using BasicTS on Linux systems (*e.g.* Ubuntu and CentOS). 
Other systems (*e.g.*, Windows and macOS) have not been tested.

### Python

Python >= 3.6 (recommended >= 3.9).

[Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) are recommended to create a virtual python environment.

### Other Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Warning

BasicTS is built on PyTorch 1.9.1 or 1.10.0, while other versions have not been tested.


## ðŸŽ¯ Getting Started of Developing with BasicTS

### Preparing Data

- **Clone BasicTS**

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/project
    git clone https://github.com/zezhishao/BasicTS.git
    ```

- **Download Raw Data**

    You can download all the raw datasets at [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14EJVODCU48fGK0FkyeVom_9lETh80Yjp) or [Baidu Yun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/18qonT9l1_NbvyAgpD4381g)(password: 0lrk), and unzip them to `datasets/raw_data/`.

- **Pre-process Data**

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/project
    python scripts/data_preparation/${DATASET_NAME}/generate_training_data.py
    ```

    Replace `${DATASET_NAME}` with one of `METR-LA`, `PEMS-BAY`, `PEMS03`, `PEMS04`, `PEMS07`, `PEMS08`, or any other supported dataset. The processed data will be placed in `datasets/${DATASET_NAME}`.

    Or you can pre-process all datasets by.

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/project
    bash scripts/data_preparation/all.sh
    ```

### 3 Steps to Evaluate Your Model

- **Define Your Model Architecture**

    The `forward` function needs to follow the conventions of BasicTS. You can find an example of the Multi-Layer Perceptron (`MLP`) model in [examples/MLP/mlp_arch.py](examples/MLP/mlp_arch.py)

- **Define Your Runner for Your Model** (Optional)

    BasicTS provides a unified and standard pipeline in `basicts.runner.BaseTimeSeriesForecastingRunner`.
    Nevertheless, you still need to define the specific forward process (the `forward` function in the **runner**).
    Fortunately, BasicTS also provides such an implementation in `basicts.runner.SimpleTimeSeriesForecastingRunner`, which can cover most of the situations.
    [The runner](examples/MLP/mlp_runner.py) for the `MLP` model can also use this built-in runner.
    You can also find more runners in `basicts.runners.runner_zoo` to learn more about the runner design.

- **Configure your Configuration File**

    You can configure all the details of the pipeline and hyperparameters in a configuration file, *i.e.*, **everything is based on config**.
    The configuration file is a `.py` file, in which you can import your model and runner and set all the options. BasicTS uses `EasyDict` to serve as a parameter container, which is extensible and flexible to use.
    An example of the configuration file for the `MLP` model on the `METR-LA` dataset can be found in [examples/MLP/MLP_METR-LA.py](examples/MLP/MLP_METR-LA.py)

### Run It!

An example of a start script can be found in [examples/run.py](examples/run.py).
You can run your model by the following command:

```bash
python examples/run.py -c /path/to/your/config/file.py --gpus '0'
```

## ðŸ“Œ Examples

### Reproducing Built-in Models

BasicTS provides a wealth of built-in models. You can find all the built-in models and their corresponding runners in [`basicts/archs/arch_zoo`](basicts/archs/arch_zoo/) and [`basicts/runners/runner_zoo`](basicts/runners/runner_zoo/), respectively. You can reproduce these models by running the following command:

```bash
python examples/run.py -c examples/${MODEL_NAME}/${MODEL_NAME}_${DATASET_NAME}.py --gpus '0'
```

Replace `${DATASET_NAME}` and `${MODEL_NAME}` with any supported models and datasets. For example, you can run Graph WaveNet[2] on METR-LA dataset by:

```bash
python examples/run.py -c examples/GWNet/GWNet_METR-LA.py --gpus '0'
```
